                                Safety coupled with comfort was our prime concern from the very
                                first day of our inception of idea of building a tourist vessel
                                and this remained focused throughout the construction feature.
                                But safety is a continuous process and need monitoring,
                                evaluation and improvement on a regular basis. The vessel is
                                manned by well trained staff and at present under the command of
                                a master who used to work for Bangladesh Navy. The vessel and
                                every voyage of her will be monitored by ex-shipâ€™s captain to
                                ensure the safety of the vessel and the passenger.
