                    It was a beautiful evening of early February, and we had just
                    completed a tour of the Sundarbans. It was simply an amazing
                    experience other than a little trouble we had with the boat that
                    carried us. As Mariners we felt the boat was unstable. Next morning,
                    we sat down together to discuss the issues relating to the safety and
                    comfort of the tourist travelling to Sundarbans. Over the next couple
                    of months, we drew sketches after sketches and kept modifying them to
                    get something close to our dream. By May 2013, we could finalize our
                    sketches. We then approached one of the best naval architects in
                    Bangladesh, and expressed our emotions and concerns. <br /> <br /> The journey
                    began. The construction process had gone through a number of
                    modifications, amendments and corrections – this delayed the delivery
                    of the vessel for more than six months – but was required to bring the
                    fineness on the curvatures, shape, and look of our dream lady, and to
                    improve on safety. Our twenty months of hard work paid off when we got
                    “The Sail” – your ultimate dream of tourism in Bangladesh. <br /><br /> It is the
                    result of a joint effort by the owners who were ship captains, marine
                    engineers, and electrical engineers, and one of the most reputed ship
                    builders in Bangladesh - The Radiant Shipyard. The staff of “The Sail”
                    remains standby to welcome you onboard – we assure you of a lifetime
                    experience.
