        description: "Safety coupled with comfort was our prime concern from the very first day of our inception of idea of building a tourist vessel and this remained focused throughout the construction feature. But safety is a continuous process and need monitoring, evaluation and improvement on a regular basis. The vessel is manned by well trained staff and at present under the command of a master who used to work for Bangladesh Navy. The vessel and every voyage of her will be monitored by ex-ship’s captain to ensure the safety of the vessel and the passenger."
